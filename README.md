A repository for my Salt Stack + Vagrant setup. It currently uses the Salty Vagrant plugin in a masterless mode.

### Version Compatability ###
Currently I'm using the following versions. You may get mixed results if you deviate from these versions.

### Background ###
I am really new to using Salt so I welcome constructive feedback about any recipes as well as tips and tricks. If you're new as well I recommend reading the Vagrant, Salty Vagrant and the Salt Stack documentation.
